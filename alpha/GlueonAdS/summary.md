Okay thank you very much!

So we know that in AdS/CFT it's possible to "move the CFT into the bulk" with the TTbar deformation.

The dual theory then lives on this cutoff cylinder within the bulk.

However, this only works for one sign of the deformation parameter mu,
while TTbar itself should be valid for both signs of mu.

In this work we generalize the proposal by "going beyond infinity", or "pushing the CFT outwards".
We call this the glue-on proposal.

We hope that this extended geometry will help us understand more about TTbar holography,
including its entanglement entropy.

You can find me on the third floor if you are interested. Thank you!
